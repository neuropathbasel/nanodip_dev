# nanodip_dev
Development repostitory of NanoDiP

This is the development branch of NanoDiP, supporting ONT's R10 pore chemistry as well as Illumina's EPIC V2 Human Methylation microarray. It has so far been tested on the **ORIN 32 GB developer kit** from Nvidia. The stable branch is https://github.com/neuropathbasel/nanodip, supporting R9 chemistry and 450K/EPIC V1 microarrays.

A demonstration VM image or the last stable release is available from https://www.epidip.org and https://epidip.usb.ch. NanoDiP supports ONT sequencing control through the MinKNOW API provided by ONT and also represents the computational backend of EpiDiP, https://www.epidip.org and https://epidip.usb.ch.
